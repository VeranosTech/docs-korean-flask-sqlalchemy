"If you are planning on using only one application you can largely skip "
"this chapter.  Just pass your application to the :class:`SQLAlchemy` "
"constructor and you're usually set.  However if you want to use more than"

"want to read on."

"What it does is prepare the application to work with :class:`SQLAlchemy`."
"  However that does not now bind the :class:`SQLAlchemy` object to your "
"application.  Why doesn't it do that? Because there might be more than "
"one application created."

"So how does :class:`SQLAlchemy` come to know about your application? You "
"will have to setup an application context.  If you are working inside a "
"Flask view function or a CLI command, that automatically happens. "
"However, if you are working inside the interactive shell, you will have "
"to do that yourself (see `Creating an Application Context "
"<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/appcontext/#creating-an-application-"
"context>`_)."
