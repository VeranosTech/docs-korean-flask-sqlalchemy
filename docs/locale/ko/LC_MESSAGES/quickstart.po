"Once created, that object then contains all the functions and helpers "

"Note how we never defined a ``__init__`` method on the ``User`` class? "
"That's because SQLAlchemy adds an implicit constructor to all model "

"As you can see, there is no need to add the ``Post`` objects to the "

"associated with it through relationships will be added too.  It does not "
"matter whether :meth:`db.session.add() "
"<sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.add>` is called before or after creating "
"these objects.  The association can also be done on either side of the "
"relationship - so a post can be created with a category or it can be "
"added to the list of posts of the category."

#: ../../quickstart.rst:130

"Let's look at the posts. Accessing them will load them from the database "
"since the relationship is lazy-loaded, but you will probably not notice "
"the difference - loading a list is quite fast::"

#: ../../quickstart.rst:137
msgid ""
"While lazy-loading a relationship is fast, it can easily become a major "
"bottleneck when you end up triggering extra queries in a loop for more "
"than a few objects.  For this case, SQLAlchemy lets you override the "
"loading strategy on the query level. If you wanted a single query to load"
" all categories and their posts, you could do it like this::"
